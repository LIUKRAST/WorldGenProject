# OpenWorldgen

This mod is just a test im making, be free to analyze the code and help me if you would like

## DO NOT OPEN IN ALREADY USED WORLDS!

The mod generates custom surface inside of two dimensions, the overworld and a custom dimension called "frozenblock:math".
In order to access this dimension, use `/execute in frozenblock:math run tp [name] 0 200 0`. Normal overworld is currently corrupted,thats why you should not use this mod inside 
worlds you care about.

## Setup
In order to use the mod, you can install an IDE (For example, install [Intellij IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) <- use community edition!), and after installation, hit get from VSC and use the link of this repository. This will clone the project on your pc and allow you to run the game!
